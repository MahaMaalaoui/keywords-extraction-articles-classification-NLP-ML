keywords extraction and articles classification.
In articles, keywords are an important element since they represent the content of the article. 
Keywords also play a crucial role in locating the article from information retrieval systems, bibliographic databases and for search engine optimization. 
The keywords also help to classify the article according to the subject or the discipline.

In this context, our project consists of applying NLP (Natural Language Processing) and Deep Learning techniques to help extract the keywords from an article
and deduce whether the article is about covid-19 or not.

Since the objective of our project is to understand the concept of keyword extraction, the use of the full text of the article leads to a great computational complexity, we will only use the summaries for NLP modeling. The same work can be applied to all the text of the article to obtain better keyword extraction.
